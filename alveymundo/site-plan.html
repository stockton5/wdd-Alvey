      <h3>How to move the pieces</h3>
      <p>
        In order to play the game you need to know all of the moves.
        <hr>
        The first piece is the pawn. The pawn can only move forward one space at a time. However, on the first move it can move two spaces. The pawn can only capture a piece if it is diagonal from it. The pawn can also be promoted to any other piece if it reaches the other side of the board.
        <hr>
        The next piece is the rook. The rook can move any number of spaces in a straight line. It can move horizontally or vertically. The rook can capture any piece that is in its path.
        <hr>
        The next piece is the knight. The knight moves in an L shape. It can move two spaces in one direction and then one space in a direction perpendicular to the first. The knight is the only piece that can jump over other pieces.
        <hr>
        The next piece is the bishop. The bishop can move any number of spaces diagonally. The bishop can only move on one color of square. The bishop can capture any piece that is in its path.
        <hr>
        The next piece is the queen. The queen can move any number of spaces in any direction. The queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The queen can capture any piece that is in its path.
        <hr>
        The last piece is the king. The king can move one space in any direction. The king can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The king can capture any piece that is in its path. The king is the most important piece because if it is captured the game is over.
        <hr>
        The object of the game is to checkmate the other player's king. This means that the king is in a position to be captured and there is no way to get out of it.
        <hr>
        The game can also end in a draw. This can happen if there is a stalemate which is when the player whose turn it is to move cannot make a move that wouldn't get his king captured or neither player has enough pieces to checkmate the other player.
        <hr>
        There is also a move known as castling. This is when the king moves two spaces towards a rook and the rook moves to the other side of the king. This move can only be done if neither piece has moved yet and there are no pieces in between them. This move is used to get the king to safety and to get the rook into a better position.
        <hr>
        The last move is called en passant. This is when a pawn moves two spaces forward and lands next to an opponent's pawn. The opponent's pawn can capture the pawn as if it had only moved one space. This move can only be done on the turn immediately after the pawn moves two spaces.

      <h3>Chess History</h3>
      <p>
        The game of chess was born in India during the Gupta dynasty in the 6th century. Today, more than 1500 years later, it is played in 172 countries. <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/a-game-of-thrones-how-chess-conquered-the-world-salar-jung-museum/fgUhNlxUQVZ2Kg?hl=en"><sup>1</sup></a> </p>

        Chess has a history spanning over 1500 years. The earliest predecessor of the game probably originated in India, before the 6th century AD; a minority of historians believe the game originated in China. From India, the game spread to Persia. When the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to Southern Europe. In Europe, chess evolved into roughly its current form in the 15th century. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chess"><sup>2</sup></a> </p>

        The first modern chess tournament was held in London in 1851. The World Chess Championship is generally held every two years. The current world champion is Magnus Carlsen of Norway. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship"><sup>3</sup></a> </p>

        Chess has risen and fallen in popularity throughout the ages with the most recent rise in popularity being due to the Netflix series The Queen's Gambit and live streaming platforms like twitch and youtube. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen%27s_Gambit_(miniseries)"><sup>4</sup></a> </p>

        The game of chess has been played by some of the greatest minds in history. Some of the most famous players include Bobby Fischer, Garry Kasparov, and Magnus Carlsen. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_chess_champions"><sup>5</sup></a> </p>

        Chess developed its current ranking system in 1970. The system is called the Elo rating system. The system is named after its creator Arpad Elo. The system is used to rank players based on their performance in games. The system is used in many other games and sports as well. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system"><sup>6</sup></a> </p>
