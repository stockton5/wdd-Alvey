            <p>The game of chess was born in India during the Gupta dynasty in the 6th century. Today, more than 1500
                years later, it is played in 172 countries. 1

                Chess has a history spanning over 1500 years. The earliest predecessor of the game probably originated
                in India, before the 6th century AD; a minority of historians believe the game originated in China. From
                India, the game spread to Persia. When the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim
                world and subsequently spread to Southern Europe. In Europe, chess evolved into roughly its current form
                in the 15th century. 2
                The first modern chess tournament was held in London in 1851. The World Chess Championship is generally
                held every two years. The current world champion is Magnus Carlsen of Norway. 3

            <p>Chess has risen and fallen in popularity throughout the ages with the most recent rise in popularity
                being due to the Netflix series The Queen's Gambit and live streaming platforms like twitch and youtube.

                The game of chess has been played by some of the greatest minds in history. Some of the most famous
                players include Bobby Fischer, Garry Kasparov, and Magnus Carlsen. 5
                Chess developed its current ranking system in 1970. The system is called the Elo rating system. The
                system is named after its creator Arpad Elo. The system is used to rank players based on their
                performance in games. The system is used in many other games and sports as well. 6
